Vending Machine System

Project Description

This project is a Java-based simulation of a real-world vending machine system. It allows users to interact with the vending machine by inserting money, selecting products (such as drinks and snacks), and receiving items if sufficient funds are available. The system also handles change calculation and provides a user-friendly interface for both customers and machine operators.

The vending machine supports different user roles:

- Buyers can browse the inventory, add money, choose products, and receive items or change.

- Operators can restock products, update prices, and review profit sheets.

This simulation models realistic vending machine behaviors including:

- Inventory management

- Product comparison and sorting

- Transaction processing and cash handling

- Simple data recording (e.g., profit sheets)

The design uses object-oriented principles such as inheritance, abstraction, and interfaces to ensure flexibility, scalability, and clean code architecture.

 Key Features:

🛒 Product selection with quantity tracking

💰 Cash input, validation, and change return

🔄 Real-time inventory display

🔧 Operator controls for restocking and price updates

📂 Profit sheet reading and data tracking

⚖️ Product comparison using custom comparators
